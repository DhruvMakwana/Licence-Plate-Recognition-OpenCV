#A bilateral filter is used for smoothening images and reducing noise, while preserving

#To counter this problem, the non-linear bilateral filter was introduced.

#simple example of how to detect edges in Python.

#cv2.RETR_LIST retrieves all of the contours without establishing any

#Contours are defined as the line joining all the points along the boundary of an image 
#that are having the same intensity. Contours come handy in shape analysis, finding the 
#size of the object of interest, and object detection. OpenCV has findContour() function 
#that helps in extracting the contours from the image.
